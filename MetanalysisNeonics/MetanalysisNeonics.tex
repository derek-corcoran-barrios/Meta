\section{Methods}\label{methods}

All analysis were carried away with the R Statistical Software (R Core
Team 2016), all meta-analyses were made on the metafor package
(Viechtbauer 2010). Our estimations were based on the use of
random/mixed-effects models form of meta-analyses, which provide an
unconditional inference about a larger set of studies from which the k
studies included in the meta-analysis are assumed to be a random sample
(L. V. Hedges and Vevea 1998). This estimations do not assume that this
larger set consists only of studies that have actually been conducted,
but instead envision a hypothetical population of studies that comprises
studies that have been conducted, that could have been conducted, or
that may be conducted in the future (L. V. Hedges and Vevea 1998).

We used the \emph{escalc} function of the metafor package to estimate
the effect size estimates (Viechtbauer 2010), we used the
\emph{standardized mean difference with heteroscedastic population
variances in the two groups} (SDMH) as our estimator for effect size
(Bonett 2009), the metafor package also corrects the slight positive
bias of the estimation following (Wasserman, Hedges, and Olkin 1988). To
be extra conservative we used the unbiased estimates of the sampling
variances. In all cases the residual heterogeneity estimator was Hedges.

Since we used mixed effect models we used the The Knapp and Hartung
adjustment \textbf{(Knapp and Hartung, 2003)} to test the individual
coefficients of the model.

\subsection{Test for (Residual)
Heterogeneity}\label{test-for-residual-heterogeneity}

For each model we tested for residual heterogeneity, if we used models
without moderators, then the Cochran's Q-test (Cochran 1954) was used to
test whether the variability in the observed effect sizes or outcomes is
larger than would be expected based on sampling variability alone.
\emph{A significant test suggests that the true effects or outcomes are
heterogeneous}. When moderators were included in the models the
Q\_E-test for residual heterogeneity was used, this tests whether the
variability in the observed effect sizes or outcomes not accounted for
by the moderators included in the model is larger than would be expected
based on sampling variability alone. When using moderators to explain
more variability a pseudo R squared was computed following (Raudenbush
2009).

\section{Results}\label{results}

As we can see in figure 1, the most common type of performance measured
in studies was abundance, with 101 estimations, followed by reproduction
with 44 estimation, behavior with 23, and finally survival and condition
with 16 each.

\subsection{Overall effect size}\label{overall-effect-size}

As we can see in table 1 and figure 2, all estimations of the effects
are negative. However, only abundance, survival and condition have
significative negative effects. Survival has the highest effect size,
with a mean difference estimation of -5.32

\section{Estimations using
moderators:}\label{estimations-using-moderators}

\section{Abundance}\label{abundance}

\subsubsection{Abundance and functional
group}\label{abundance-and-functional-group}

Using functional group as a moderator yields the following results

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}rrrlrr@{}}
\caption{effect size of the Standardized mean difference of abundance
for each functional group and it's standard error}\tabularnewline
\toprule
estimate & ci.ub & ci.lb & group & p & n\tabularnewline

-0.787 & 0.011 & -1.585 & predator & 0.053 & 36\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

the the psuedo R squared for this model was 0.06, that is despite the
mixed and omnivore funtional groups being statistically significant,
functional group on its own does not explain the variability of the
results very well.

\centering
\includegraphics{MetanalysisNeonics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-6-1.pdf}
\caption{effect size of the Standardized mean difference of abundance

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Abundance and nesting

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}rrrlrr@{}}
\caption{effect size of the Standardized mean difference of abundance
controling for nesting area and it's standard error}\tabularnewline

0.523 & 3.305 & -2.259 & ground & 0.713 & 0\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

the the psuedo R squared for using nesting area as the only moderator
was 0, this model does not explain much.

\subsubsection{Abundance and concentration
(ppb)}\label{abundance-and-concentration-ppb}

When we use concentration as parts per billion, the number of effect
sizes diminishes from 101 to only nine.

Despite that, the r squared of this model is 0.45, that is over 40
percent of cariability explained by this factor alone. The relationship
between concentration and Abundance can be seen in figure 4.

\subsubsection{Abundance and concentration (Kg/Ha) for Powder/granular
treatment}\label{abundance-and-concentration-kgha-for-powdergranular-treatment}

When we use concentration as parts per billion, the number of effect
sizes diminishes from 101 to only nine.

Despite that, the r squared of this model is 0.04, that is over 40
percent of cariability explained by this factor alone. The relationship
between concentration and Abundance can be seen in figure 4.

\subsubsection{Abundance and concentration (g/Kg) for seed
treatment}\label{abundance-and-concentration-gkg-for-seed-treatment}

When we use concentration as parts per billion, the number of effect
sizes diminishes from 101 to only nine.

Despite that, the r squared of this model is 0.27, that is over 40
percent of cariability explained by this factor alone. The relationship
between concentration and Abundance can be seen in figure 4.

\subsubsection{Abundance concentration and functional
group}\label{abundance-concentration-and-functional-group}

Again, when we have concentration, the number of studies is reduced form
101 to nine.

Adding functional group to the model increases R squared to 0.85
